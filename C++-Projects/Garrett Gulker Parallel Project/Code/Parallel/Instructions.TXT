TO RUN FILE:
1. place all files but this one inside stampede
2. compile code:  icpc CipherParallel.cpp -o CipherParallel.exe -lpthread
3. execute code:  sbatch CipherParallelScript
4. runtime will be found in "CipherParallel.o" file
5. output of the program will be found in the "output.txt" file
5a. output will be organized:
ORIGINAL MESSAGE
================
ENCRYPTED MESSAGE
================

TO CHANGE THREADS USED:
1.in the .cpp file there is a variable called NUM_THREADS change that to the amount of
  threads you wish to use
2.in the CipherParallelScript file OMP_NUM_THREADS needs to be changed to the same
